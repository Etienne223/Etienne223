### Hi there 👋

I'm Etienne 26, junior web developer following the BeCode bootcamp. Whether it was during my studies at EPHEC or more recently at BeCode, I have often had the opportunity to apply my skills learned during courses for real clients. These different experiences allowed me to gain a strong sense of responsibility, but also improved my ability to work in a team effectively and autonomously using agile project development methods. 

Currently learning a lot about JavaScript ES6 and Javascript Framwork : ReactJs for the frontend and AdonisJs for the backend. You can see several of those projects pinned on my GitHub page.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 Currently on a Quiz Plateform where people can add their own question packages to play with their friend.
- 🌱Learning AdonisJS and ReactJS
- 💬 Don't mind asking me anything about me or my project I'll be glad to answer to your questions!

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Octopus arms have their own mind, they can work independently from the rest of the octopus. (Yepe I'm an animal lover and watch a lot of documentary about them 🐙🦝)
